## API Endpoint ðŸšª
If you want to access our endpoints, you first need to access the register and login endpoints to get the JWT Token for credentials to access our Machine Learning API endpoints. You can access register and login endpoints from [Register API](https://dermoally-vvergznbcq-et.a.run.app/register) and [Login API](https://dermoally-vvergznbcq-et.a.run.app/login). For details, please check the tables below to see the API documentation and which endpoints need the JWT Token (shown in the checklist):

 ```
- Fourth, go to this project's root directory in the Cloud Shell.
- Fifth, copy the command below to build the image container and upload it to the Container Registry.
 ```
gcloud builds submit \
  --tag gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/your-ml-api
  ```
- Sixth, copy the command below to deploy your image container to Cloud Run.
 ```
 gcloud run deploy your-ml-api \
  --image gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/your-ml-api \
  --platform managed \
  --region your-region \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --max-instances=3 \
  --port=9000 \
  --memory=8Gi
 ```
